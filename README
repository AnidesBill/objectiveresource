h2. Overview

ObjectiveResource is a port of Rail's ActiveRecord framework to Objective-C.

The primary purpose of this project is to quickly and easily connect 
iPhone applications with servers running Rails. 

A secondary goal of this project is to provide some popular Rubyisms to 
Objective-C. This work can be found in the ActiveSupport group.
